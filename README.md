# Savannah AgriTech Sheep – Website (Styled, mailto contact)

This is a responsive static site with your logo and a **mailto** contact button (works on GitHub Pages).

## Deploy to GitHub Pages
1) Create a public repo and upload these files to **main**.
2) In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source = GitHub Actions**.
3) The included workflow `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` auto-publishes your site.

## Customize
- Replace `assets/logo.png` if you update your logo.
- Phones & email in `index.html` and `contact.html`.
- Update the mailto subject/body in `contact.html` to your exact wording.
